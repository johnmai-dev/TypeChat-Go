I'd like two large, one with pepperoni and the other with extra sauce.  The pepperoni gets basil and the extra sauce gets Canadian bacon.  And add a whole salad. Make the Canadian bacon a medium. Make the salad a Greek with no red onions.  And give me two Mack and Jacks and a Sierra Nevada.  Oh, and add another salad with no red onions.
